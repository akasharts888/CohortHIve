# 🧠 CohortHive – Your AI Tutor That Teaches You Daily

CohortHive is an AI-powered personal tutor designed to help learners master any subject through **daily teaching**, **personalized quizzes**, and **intelligent progress tracking**. It acts like a human educator—teaching new concepts every day, testing prior knowledge, and ensuring there's no repetition in the learning path.

---

## 🚀 Features

* 📚 **Daily Lessons**: Automatically introduces a new concept every day based on your curriculum.
* 🧪 **Smart Quizzes**: Begins each session with a short test to reinforce previous lessons.
* 🧠 **Progress Memory**: Tracks what you’ve already learned to prevent repetition.
* 🗃️ **Topic Tracking System**: Uses structured storage (e.g., database or file) to log and manage concepts taught.
* 🔄 **Feedback-Driven**: Adapts based on test performance and user feedback.
* 📊 **Analytics (optional)**: Visualize progress and learning patterns (if extended).

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

* **Language**: Python (Core Logic)
* **Framework**: Streamlit / Flask (for UI if web-based)
* **LLM API**: OpenAI / Cohere / Local LLM (e.g., Mistral or Llama2)
* **Storage**: JSON / SQLite / Firebase (for concept tracking)
* **State Management**: In-memory for session, persistent for history
* **Scheduling**: Cron or Background Jobs (for daily concept trigger)

## 🧠 How It Works

1. **Startup**: When a user opens the app, CohortHive checks the last taught topic.
2. **Daily Test**: Begins by assessing yesterday’s lesson through a short quiz.
3. **New Lesson**: Teaches a new concept from a pre-defined domain or user-defined input.
4. **Record Keeping**: Logs the concept to avoid repetition and track learning.
5. **Feedback Loop** *(optional)*: Adjusts topic depth or pace based on quiz score.

---

## ✨ Use Cases

* Students learning programming, data science, or mathematics
* Professionals mastering LLM Engineering or AI topics
* Educators creating AI-driven learning assistants
* Personalized learning environments

---

## 🔍 Example Prompt Usage

```python
"Today's topic is Reinforcement Learning. Here's a short test on yesterday’s lesson: Transformers."
```

```python
"Based on user performance, explain today's concept with a real-world analogy and code snippet."
```
